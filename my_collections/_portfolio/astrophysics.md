## <a class="button button--success button--rounded button--lg" style="background:brown"><u>Recommended Software and Tools</u>:</a>
### IRAF-related:
- [IRAF github page](https://iraf-community.github.io/): "Image Reduction and Analysis Facility" (IRAF) is one of the oldest but most useful tools nowadays when dealing with astronomical data. It was developed in the 1980's decade by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) in Tucson, Arizona. However, development and maintenance of IRAF is discontinued since 2012. The latest release had a large number of problems, including major license issues and security bugs. Although it's old, it's utility,
    compatibility and wide of use in the astronomy world is making their users to find workarounds and overpass bugs in order to continue using it. One of the most promising packages involved is the Pyraf wrapper for Python.
    - [GitHub project](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/): The official GitHub repository for the project (discontinued).
    - [Pyraf](https://github.com/iraf-community/pyraf/): A very interesting module in Python to include the tools in the IRAF package.
    - [Customer support](https://iraf.net/): An (intented to be) actualized webpage to support customers using IRAF.
- [SExtractor](http://astroa.physics.metu.edu.tr/MANUALS/sextractor/): Source-Extractor (SExtractor) is a program that builds a catalogue of objects from an astronomical image.
- [DS9](https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9): SAOImageDS9 is an astronomical imaging and data visualization application.  DS9 supports FITS images and binary tables, multiple frame buffers, region manipulation, and many scale algorithms and colormaps. 
- [TOPCAT](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/): TOPCAT is an interactive graphical viewer and editor for tabular data. Its aim is to provide most of the facilities that astronomers need for analysis and manipulation of source catalogues and other tables, though it can be used for non-astronomical data as well.

### Python:
- [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/): A core package for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Python.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): This is my recommended framework for Deep Learning and Machine Learning tasks. It is more integrated with Python, which is cool once you get used to this language and it provides high manipulation capabilities in certain black-box scenarios where other alternatives usually decay. Other alternatives for the same purposes are, in order of relevance: [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/)
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/): This is one of the most interesting features for interactive and exploratory Python out there. Those widely-used and extremely handy notebooks are nowadays an standard to effectively communicate and transmit science and Python routines. As an enhancemente, [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a more useful GUI and extensions that can be enabled one-by-one.
- [Essential Core in Python](https://www.dezyre.com/article/top-5-libraries-for-data-science-in-python/196): What to say about eternal scientific packages? Top 5 for me: **numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn** 
- [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/): As everyone knows (or should), there are plenty of full-integrated standard libraries in Python for most common tasks. Also, there is little effort to create your oun functions and accomplish most of the things.

### Specific areas:
- [Vapor](https://www.vapor.ucar.edu/): Interesting software for running simulations in 2D/3D. It is well known in solar physics. An interesting alternative is [VISIT](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Docker is a CaaS(Container-as-a-Service) platform, you can build your own software from predefined packages from multi-architectures. Generally, you don't need anything else but to know Docker to start any software instance on your computer. As an enhance, [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) provides you with a GPU runtime to leverage your docker containers.
