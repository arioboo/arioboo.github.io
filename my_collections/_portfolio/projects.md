## <a class="button button--primary button--outline button--rounded button--md"><u>Motivations:</u></a>
I consider myself a person for which a good job, status and personal relationships are not enough. We are living a few moments in this life, but we have to be sure we can make a contribution to the world and put the human being at a better spot. I am not afraid to say that my contribution in that sense seems worthless at this moment, but I remain hopeful to kind of achieve this goal one day.

I'm developing some of the next section projects in my spare time. Anyone willing to collaborate can send me an e-mail to get closer.

**Postdata:** My admiration on older people, at the moment I'm writing this, is enormous. They are suffering the Covid-19 worse consequences, and getting so little from us. Please if you are reading this, I would like to remind you helping these people stay connected and live their deserved retirement to the fullest. They deserve the best.

- [Covid 19 Dashboard](https://github.com/arioboo/covid19_dashboard) , <https://my-covid19-dash.herokuapp.com/main> : This is my little grain of sand and tribute to all the victims of this sanitary disaster. It calls an API serving data from Spain. Serves as an Heroku app to visualize and interact with the dashboard, made in Bokeh. In continued development.
- [Personal Portfolio](https://github.com/arioboo/arioboo.github.io): This same webpage.  
- [LorDB](https://github.com/LorDB-company/LorDB): LorDB is a personal project that intends to be a database sharing service and website. Collaboration is welcomed, currently trying to find front-end developers for the project.
- [Chess-Analyzer](https://github.com/Chess-Improvers/chess-analyzer): This is a personal attempt to build an automatic chess analysis with clear parameters and automatic trascript of games. AI will be developed alongside the project. Collaboration is welcomed, specially for people related to chess programming.
- **Upcoming book**: I can't reveal details on it, but soon or later I will finish a book and put it for free to everyone in the web. Keep an eye on!

*There are more projects that better fit into other categories. Here I put some general or long-term projects or ideas I'd like to develop or I'm involved in.*
